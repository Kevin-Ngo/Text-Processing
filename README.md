# Text-Processing
This is a simple implementation of the KMP and BM algorithm for a Data Structures/Algorithms II class project at Mt. SAC.

The Pattern_Matching.java has few methods defined but its main purpose is to search a text for a pattern and while doing so, collect data pertaining to the search.

There is also a little driver attached to test the methods.
