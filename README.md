# Text-Processing
This is a simple implementation of the KMP and BM algorithm for a Data Structures/Algorithms II class project at community college.

The "Pattern_Matching.java" has only a few methods defined, but its main purpose is to search through a given text for a pattern and while doing so, collect data pertaining to the efficiency of search.

There is also a small driver attached to test the methods that can be found called "Pattern_Matching_Driver.java" and in addition, several text files that were used during the testing.

The results regarding the efficiency of each matching tactic can be viewed via the "results.txt" file.
